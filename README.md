[1.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52921614) Create database to store Username and Password information from completing the signup form on signup.py
* Created [flaskmain.py](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/flaskmain.py) with POST method to push username and password information to database. If else statement used, else code used, to test for errors in code. 
* Created [user.py](https://gist.github.com/avabrooks/ea2f743a91e594ddd5afc01387217f3b) to create functions defining the database and the variables in it. 
* Created [chess.db](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/chess.db) to store usernames and passwords. Also created a blank one in case of error. 
* How to run: 
    1. From home page select sign up button. 
    2. Fill out the 3 fields, the form will not go through without filling out all fields.The form will also not go through if your passwords do not match(CSS integration).
    3. After creating your account, you will be redirected to the play menu, where the chess games will soon be implemented.
    4. Example of completed code showing data in database [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FsY9-SmcStAdhVpmfUdrwxXERZDZkiBrXjHaocRAvAM/edit)
    5. Goal for next week: Connect database so users can log in. 
 
[2.](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/projects/1#card-52931009) Design, and create the leaderboards page to eventually be used with a database.
* Created [leaderboards.html](https://github.com/kylem314/P5-Gim-Vamps-Project/blob/main/templates/leaderboards.html)
* Used a variety of CSS styles to make it look really beautiful
* How to run:
    1. Starting at the home page, select the leaderboards button.
    2. Scroll down and view various users' ELO, their amount of wins, and their spot on the board.
    3. Eventually, upon completion of a game and gaining/losing some ELO, you can then have the option to go straight to the leaderboards to see where you have moved to.

* Username/Password login system w/ profiles
* Database of profiles with statistics based on previous games
    * For example, a user could search for their win rate against another user, or find their games with that user
* Be able to view match history, and see game codes to see your past games
* Play against other players, or against an AI with different difficulties
* Be able to replay past games from a database
* Rules & Settings

## Big Ticket Goals:
* A working chess game, integrated into our website
* Profile system using a database, where people can find data such as past games, winrate, etc.
* Menu to navigate to all parts of the website
